# Progressia
A free, open-source sandbox survival game currently in early development.

## Description

The game  has barely  begun development  so much  of its  features are yet to be
implemented.

In broader terms, Progressia  is a challenging game  about survival, exploration
and engineering  in a realistic voxel  sandbox environment. The game  is heavily
inspired  by Minecraft  technology mods, Factorio, Vintage Story  and  Minetest.
Progressia's  main  unique  features will  include  highly  composite  items and
blocks,  a    realistically-scaled   world,  temperature    mechanics   and    a
parallelism-capable server.

See [Building Guide](docs/BuildingGuide.md) for building instructions.
